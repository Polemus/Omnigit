# Contents/MacOS is a code location: codesign treats everything in it as code and
# refuses to seal a bundle holding anything there it cannot verify. A plain
# self-contained publish drops ~200 managed assemblies in beside the executable,
# none of them Mach-O, and sealing the bundle fails with
#
#     Omnigit.app: code object is not signed at all
#     In subcomponent: .../Contents/MacOS/System.Diagnostics.Contracts.dll
#
# Single-file publishing packs the managed assemblies into the executable itself
# and leaves the native libraries beside it, so everything left in that directory
# is Mach-O and signable. IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract is deliberately
# left off: the .dylib files stay visible and get signed individually, which is
# the inside-out order Apple asks for, and nothing has to be extracted to a
# temporary directory at run time to be loaded.
