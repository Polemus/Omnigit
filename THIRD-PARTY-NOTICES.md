# Third-party notices

Omnigit is [MIT licensed](LICENSE). Its release builds are self-contained — the .NET
runtime, the rendering stack and the native git library are all inside the download, so
users need nothing installed. That means the binaries you download from the Releases page
contain the following third-party software, and this file is the attribution that comes
with it.

Everything here permits redistribution in a closed or open product. Nothing in this list
imposes a copyleft obligation on Omnigit's own source.

Version numbers are those referenced by `src/Omnigit/Omnigit.csproj` and its transitive
dependencies at the time of writing; `dotnet list package --include-transitive` gives the
current set.

## The one worth reading properly

### libgit2 — GPLv2 **with a linking exception**

Shipped inside `LibGit2Sharp.NativeBinaries`. It is the native library that does all the
actual git work, and it is the reason Omnigit needs no git installation.

libgit2 is GPLv2, which would normally be a problem for an MIT application distributing
it. It isn't, because of an explicit exception granted by the libgit2 authors:

> **LINKING EXCEPTION**
>
> In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the authors give you
> unlimited permission to link the compiled version of this library into combinations
> with other programs, and to distribute those combinations without any restriction
> coming from the use of this file. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in
> other respects; for example, they cover modification of the file, and distribution when
> not linked into a combined executable.)

So: linking it into Omnigit and distributing the result is unrestricted. **Modifying
libgit2 itself** would still be covered by the GPL. Omnigit ships it unmodified.

## Other licences

### Skia — BSD 3-Clause

Bundled inside SkiaSharp's native assets. Skia is what actually draws every pixel of
Omnigit, which is why the app looks the same on all three platforms.

© Google LLC. <https://github.com/google/skia/blob/main/LICENSE>

### ANGLE — BSD 3-Clause

Bundled as `Avalonia.Angle.Windows.Natives`. Translates OpenGL ES calls to Direct3D on
Windows.

© The ANGLE Project Authors. <https://github.com/google/angle/blob/main/LICENSE>

### HarfBuzz — MIT ("Old MIT" variant)

Bundled inside HarfBuzzSharp's native assets. Text shaping.

© Behdad Esfahbod and others. <https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/COPYING>

### Markdig — BSD 2-Clause

Parses Markdown for the rendered view of a changed `.md` file. Parsing only; the drawing
is Omnigit's own.

© Alexandre Mutel. <https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/license.txt>

### SVG rendering library (`Svg.Custom`) — Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)

Shipped as `Svg.Custom`, Svg.Skia's build of the [svg-net](https://github.com/svg-net/SVG)
library, which reads an SVG document for the image viewer. MS-PL is permissive: it allows
redistribution in compiled form inside an application under any licence that complies with
it, which MIT does. Its conditions apply to the library itself — distributing *its* source
means doing so under MS-PL, and the copyright and attribution notices must be kept, which
this entry does. Omnigit ships it unmodified.

© svg-net contributors. <https://github.com/svg-net/SVG/blob/master/license.txt>

### Inter — SIL Open Font License 1.1

The typeface, embedded via `Avalonia.Fonts.Inter`. The OFL permits bundling and
redistribution with software; it forbids selling the font on its own and requires that
any modified version be renamed. Omnigit embeds it unmodified.

© The Inter Project Authors. <https://github.com/rsms/inter/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>

## Bundled text: the new-repository templates

Not code, and not linked into anything — these are files Omnigit writes into a
repository you create with it, embedded from `src/Omnigit/Resources/`. They are the same
two collections GitHub Desktop bundles for the same dialog, so a repository started here
and one started there begin identically.

### `.gitignore` templates — CC0 1.0 (public domain dedication)

The 25 files in `Resources/Gitignore/`, taken from
[github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore), which is released under
[CC0 1.0](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/LICENSE) — no attribution is
required, and this entry is a courtesy rather than an obligation.

### Licence texts — the licences themselves

The 13 files in `Resources/Licences/`, taken from
[github/choosealicense.com](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com)'s `_licenses`
folder. Each is the verbatim text of a licence, reproduced so that a repository created
here gets an accurate one; the placeholders for the year and the copyright holder are
filled in at the moment the file is written.

Reproducing a licence's text verbatim is what every licence in the set is *for*, and
none of them attaches conditions to Omnigit for shipping a copy. They are embedded
rather than typed into C# for exactly this reason — a licence retyped by hand is one
that is subtly wrong, and being subtly wrong about a licence is the failure mode worth
engineering against.

Note that the CC0 dedication and the site's own metadata are separate things: the
`choosealicense.com` *website* is CC-BY-3.0, but the licence texts themselves are not the
site's to license, and are not covered by it.

## Development-only dependencies

These are used to build and test Omnigit and are **not** present in any release binary.
Listed for completeness rather than obligation.

| Component | Version | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) | 2.9.3 | Apache-2.0 |
| [xunit.runner.visualstudio](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit) | 3.1.5 | Apache-2.0 |
| [Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk](https://github.com/microsoft/vstest) | 18.8.1 | MIT |
| [coverlet.collector](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) | 10.0.1 | MIT |
| [AvaloniaUI.DiagnosticsSupport](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) | 2.2.3 | MIT |

`AvaloniaUI.DiagnosticsSupport` is excluded from non-Debug configurations by the
`IncludeAssets`/`PrivateAssets` conditions in `Omnigit.csproj`, so it never reaches a
release build.

---

## Packaging tools

Not distributed with Omnigit, and not linked into it — these produce the installers.

- **[fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm)** — MIT — builds the `.deb` and `.rpm`.
- **[Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)** — its own permissive licence —
  builds the Windows installer.
